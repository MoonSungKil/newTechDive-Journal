author_information: "Robert C. Martin, widely known as 'Uncle Bob,' is an American software engineer, instructor, and author born on December 5, 1952. He is a prominent figure in the software development industry and is renowned for advocating various software design principles. Uncle Bob played a significant role as an author and signatory of the influential Agile Manifesto.
Throughout his career, Martin has authored numerous books and magazine articles, showcasing his expertise in software development. He served as the editor-in-chief of C++ Report magazine and was the first chairman of the Agile Alliancee. In 1991, he founded Object Mentor, a company that offered training on extreme programming.
As of March 2020, Martin operates two companies Uncle Bob Consulting, providing consulting and training services, and Clean Coders, which offers training videos. He is a strong advocate for software craftsmanship, agile software development, and test-driven development.
One of Martin's notable contributions is coining the SOLID mnemonic, encapsulating essential software principles such as the Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.
In summary, Robert C. Martin, or Uncle Bob, has significantly influenced the software development community through his writings, teachings, and advocacy for best practices and principles in software design and development."

Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.
Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer but only if you work at it.
What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.
Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.
Readers will come away from this book understanding

‣ How to tell the difference between good and bad code
‣ How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code
‣ How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes
‣ How to format code for maximum readability
‣ How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic
‣ How to unit test and practice test-driven development
