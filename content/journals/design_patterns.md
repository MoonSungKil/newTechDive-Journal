acknowledgements: "The authors, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, express their gratitude to the software development community for embracing the concepts presented in Design Patterns and contributing to the field of object-oriented software design."
author_information: "Erich Gamma is a Swiss computer scientist born on June 13, 1961. He is widely recognized for his contributions to software engineering and design patterns. Gamma earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Zurich and has held various positions in academia and industry.
Along with his co-authors, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, Erich Gamma played a pivotal role in the development of the influential book, Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. The book, often referred to as the 'Gang of Four' book, has had a profound impact on software development practices.
Erich Gamma has had a distinguished career, including working at IBM and Microsoft. He has been involved in projects such as Eclipse and JUnit, and he continues to contribute to the advancement of software engineering practices. Gamma is known for his expertise in software design, development tools, and collaboration platforms."

Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.

The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.
Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.
