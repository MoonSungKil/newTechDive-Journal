Network Programming with Go teaches you how to write clean, secure network software with the programming language designed to make it seem easy.

Build simple, reliable, network software

Combining the best parts of many other programming languages, Go is fast, scalable, and designed for high-performance networking and multiprocessing. In other words, it’s perfect for network programming.

Network Programming with Go will help you leverage Go to write secure, readable, production-ready network code. In the early chapters, you’ll learn the basics of networking and traffic routing. Then you’ll put that knowledge to use as the book guides you through writing programs that communicate using TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets to ensure reliable data transmission.

As you progress, you’ll explore higher-level network protocols like HTTP and HTTP/2 and build applications that securely interact with servers, clients, and APIs over a network using TLS.

You'll also

Network Programming with Go is all you’ll need to take advantage of Go’s built-in concurrency, rapid compiling, and rich standard library.
